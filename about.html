            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>
                The Buddenbrooks Reader is an interactive tool designed to assist German learners in reading Thomas Mann's classic novel, **"Buddenbrooks"**. This project aims to lower the barrier to entry for reading complex German literature by providing instant, contextual vocabulary support.
            </p>

            <h3>How the Vocabulary Works</h3>
            <p>
                Words highlighted in blue are part of the collaborative vocabulary database. When you hover over or click a word, you see its English and German definitions. This allows you to focus on comprehension without having to constantly look up individual words in a separate dictionary.
            </p>

            <h3>Contributing</h3>
            <p>
                This tool is built and maintained by readers like you. We rely on the community to expand the vocabulary set. If you find a word that is not defined, you can use the **"Neues Wort beitragen"** (Contribute a New Word) form on the main page to submit a new definition. All submissions are reviewed for accuracy before being added to the main vocabulary files.
            </p>

            <h3>Data and Technology</h3>
            <p>
                The vocabulary data is powered by **Firebase Firestore**, and the static JSON files used by the reader are automatically synced to this repository via a **GitHub Action**. This ensures the app is fast while keeping the vocabulary continuously updated.
            </p>
